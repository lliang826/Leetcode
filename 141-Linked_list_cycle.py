DESCRIPTION
Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached 
again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote 
the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not 
passed as a parameter.
Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

Floyd's tortoise and hare algorithm
Analogy: imagine 2 runners on a track oval (which has a cycle). One of the runners is
faster than the other. Assuming that they maintain their speeds for the entire duration,
the fast runner will eventually meet the slow runner again.
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
